## The Inverted Triangle css
At Inouit we follow the principle of Harry Robert's ITCSS.

It provides an interesting approach to the CSS structure and ordering in order to make the cascade works to our advantage. This system is designed to build a sane, scalable and managed code base. It helps reduce redundancies, ease team work while keeping the technical dept on sight.
